  about: `
--About Me--

Hi, Iâ€™m Yafer â€” a Web Developer with a background in IT Support and a strong entrepreneurial mindset.

I began my career as an IT Support Assistant at the Manila International Airport Authority, where I developed a solid foundation in technical troubleshooting and problem-solving. This experience sharpened my ability to think critically, work under pressure, and deliver effective solutions.

My involvement in business and cryptocurrency has helped me become more adaptive, resourceful, and user-centered â€” qualities that now drive my approach to software development.

I currently focus on frontend development, building responsive and modern interfaces using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, and Tailwind CSS. To become a more versatile developer, Iâ€™m expanding my skills in backend technologies like Node.js, Express.js, and beyond â€” allowing me to build complete and scalable web applications.

Iâ€™m driven by a desire to create meaningful digital experiences and continuously grow through hands-on learning and collaboration. Whether working independently or in a team, I bring focus, discipline, and a strong commitment to delivering quality results.
